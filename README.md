# Telegram Bot for Rustastic Support

This repository contains the source code for a Telegram bot designed to support customers of the Rustastic group's drone (this a part of the project made for the Advanced Programming class at UniTn).

 The bot provides quick access to the repository, open issues, and contact information for the development team.
